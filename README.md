## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Amongst my first solutions, i followed a tutorial so there is not much to explain. Was a great project and greatly contributed to the knowledge i'm having now. One think comes to my mind i should mention that i liked playing / positioning with the background image.
### Continued development

i dont plan to add anything more to this project. I think it's finished and i'm happy with it. I will continue to learn and practice with new projects.
